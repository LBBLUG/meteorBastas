Meteor BASTAS is the Be a Santa To A Senior project done in Meteor.

I chose Meteor for a few reasons:

    1. As a non-developer it's pretty easy to grasp the concepts of meteor.
    2. Setting up Meteor for the end user wanting to take advantage of this project is as simple as cloning the repo, getting into the directory created, and typing `meteor` into the terminal to start their server.
    3. I like the ability to break the project into small pieces.  When I want to adjust the list of recipients, it's easy to find those parts, and make adjustments vs. having to look through a massive javascript file or html page to make the single adjustment I may want / need.

So, as described above, to run this project on your local machine simply do the following:

    1. clone the repository.
    2. change into the directory created.
    3. type 'meteor' into the terminal window while in that directory.
    4. use http://localhost:3000 to reach the main page.

I am currently working on showing the recipients and gifts in the list view.

I have started work on uploading the original file for bulk add, and will continue that work when the list view is working properly.
